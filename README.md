Car-Evaluation-Classification
Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project focused on car evaluation classification. The goal of this project is to explore and compare different classification techniques, such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes. The dataset used for this project includes 1728 records, each representing a car evaluation based on various attributes.

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes seven attributes: buying price, maintenance price, number of doors, capacity in terms of persons, size of luggage boot, estimated safety, and the evaluation of the car (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good). The attributes are preprocessed and transformed into a binary format, and the target variable is encoded into numerical values.
